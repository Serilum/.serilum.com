				<h1>About Serilum</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm glad you've found this far corner of the internet. Here you'll find an overview of all the mods I've created and uploaded on CurseForge. With now almost a decade of experience in modding and even more with Minecraft, I felt it was time to put some more effort into public projects. It started off with the Just Mob Heads mod, and quickly got out of hand.</p>
				<p>With so many awesome mods and massive amounts of content already available, I wanted to do things a little bit differently. Instead of adding more and more features to a singular mod, I decided to make most of them minimalistically themed, by changing or adding a single feature. This way you can add a little bit extra to whatever collection you're playing without needing to extensively read a guide. The result can be seen below. I'm proud to share them all with you for free, and hope to be able to share many more in the future.</p>
				<p>A few years after my first Forge mod, I've added support for Fabric. Most mods have been ported, so you can choose which modloader you prefer. The mods that haven't been ported yet proved a little more difficult. When I have time, I'm going to do another attempt.</p>
				<p>Thank you for visiting my site and looking at my mods. It's very much appreciated!</p>
				<p>Kind regards,</p>
				<p>Rick</p>
